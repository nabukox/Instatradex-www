							<h3>
									10. Network Requirements
							</h3>

							<p>
									10.1 INSTATRADEX CORP believes in protecting all members and conducting its business professionally
									and fairly. 
							</p>
							<p>
									10.2 INSTATRADEX CORP has strict policies surrounding positions held within the program. A Member may
									only have a position in one line of sponsorship, and not in two or more. No member may register a new
									position in a line other than the first position registered with. Attempts to the contrary will be filtered out and
									blocked by INSTATRADEX CORP.
							</p>
							<p>
									10.3 INSTATRADEX CORP prohibits double sponsoring, it is not allowed. Double sponsoring happens
									when a natural person (or legal entity) intends to register as a new partner with INSTATRADEX CORP
									although he is already a registered member, or over the previous 6 months has already been a registered
									partner in another line of sponsorship. Using the name of someone’s spouse, other family member,
									corporate structure, the name of a company or association or using different identification documents or
									resorting to any other misleading practice to circumvent the “no double sponsoring” rule is also not allowed.
									Similarly, no member is allowed to entice or encourage any other partner to change sponsors and register
									under him using any of the above unethical methods. Naturally, a change of sponsors may take place if it
									has already been approved by INSTATRADEX CORP and the compliance department along with all parties
									involved or affected as described in section 10.4. 
							</p>
							<p>
									10.4 As a general rule, INSTATRADEX CORP does not support requests for a change in sponsorship lines.
									In isolated instances, however, INSTATRADEX CORP may approve such requests in the interest of the
									network as a whole – providing all affected members/sponsors (up to 7 generations up) agree in writing to 
									the requested change (downlines are not required to give their approval). In the event of a change of
									sponsorship request is examined and approved, only the partner making the request will be placed under a
									new sponsor (the partner’s downline remains intact in the old line of sponsorship and no downline will be
									repositioned); or under extreme circumstances the entire downline may be repositioned under a new
									sponsor. The partner requesting a change of sponsors will be charged a EUR 175 administration fee. The
									changes will be implemented in the structure within 30 days of approving the changes. When sponsors are
									changed, all previous activities, accumulated BV points and bonuses will be lost.
							</p>
