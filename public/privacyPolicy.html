                            <p>
                                    This sets forth our policy with regard to the use of “Spam” marketing techniques in connection with Internet
                                    Marketing. In the event that we deem you to be in violation of these policies, we shall immediately revoke
                                    your membership rights and close any active account. We have a strict policy against spamming. We forbid
                                    the sending of unsolicited mass Emails or unsolicited Emails of any kind in connection with the marketing of
                                    our programs, products and services. We reserve the right to terminate your account and participation in our
                                    programs “for cause” if we deem you to be in violation of our anti-spamming policies. We also reserve the right to suspend your account and participation pending review upon receipt of any complaint or other
                                    evidence that you may be
                                    engaging in any spamming activity. We consider spamming to be any activity whereby you directly or
                                    indirectly transmit email messages to any email address that has not solicited such email and does not
                                    consent to such transmission. We also consider spamming to constitute posting advertisements in
                                    newsgroups in violation of the terms of participation in such newsgroup, that are off topic, or in newsgroups
                                    that do not specifically permit advertisements. We also consider it spamming when advertisements are
                                    placed on message boards or in chat rooms when they are not permitted by the terms of participation in
                                    such message boards and chat rooms. If you are “spammed” by anyone regarding our products, services,
                                    website, or any other matters, please report this activity to support@instaTradex.com.
